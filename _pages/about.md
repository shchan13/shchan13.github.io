I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), advised by Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html).
Before that, I received my M.Sci degree from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) in 2019 and B.Sci defree from [National Cheng Kung University](https://www.ncku.edu.tw/) in 2017.

My research interests are based on multi-agent system. I am interested in developing heuristic search algorithms that solve [Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)](http://mapf.info/) in the large-scale environment such as automated warehouses.
