I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [UIniversity of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), advised by Professor [Sven Koenig](http://idm-lab.org/index.html).
Before that, I received my M.Sci degree from Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, in 2019.

My research interests are based on multi-agent system, especially developing heuristic search algorithms that speeds up solving [Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)](http://mapf.info/) in the large-scale environment such as automated warehouses.
